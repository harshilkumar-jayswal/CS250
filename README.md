* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   
   Creating user stories can help with interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program in several ways. First, user stories provide a clear and concise way of expressing user needs and requirements. This can help ensure that everyone involved in the project (e.g. developers, designers, project managers) has a shared understanding of what the program is supposed to do and why it is important. Second, user stories can be used to prioritize which features and functions to implement first. For example, user stories can be ranked in terms of importance or value to the user, and the most important or valuable stories can be tackled first. Finally, user stories can be used to create a shared vision for the project, which can help align everyone's efforts and ensure that the final product meets the user's needs.

* How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   
   There are several agile processes that I may want to incorporate into my future development work, depending on the specific goals and needs. Some popular agile processes include Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). Scrum is a framework for managing and completing complex projects, and it is widely used in software development. Kanban is a method for managing and improving workflows, and it is often used in combination with Scrum. Lean is a philosophy that emphasizes maximizing value and minimizing waste, and it is often used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development processes. Extreme Programming (XP) is a set of software development practices that focus on rapid feedback, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
    Ultimately, the best agile processes to incorporate into my future development work will depend on the specific goals and constraints of the projects. It may be helpful to try out different agile processes and see which ones work best for my team and my projects.

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   
   Being a good team member in software development means being a flexible and proactive problem-solver, who is able to work well with others and adapt to changing requirements. It also means being willing to collaborate with others and share knowledge and expertise, as well as being open to feedback and willing to take on new tasks and responsibilities as needed. In addition, being a good team member in software development means being committed to the success of the team and the project, and being willing to go the extra mile to help the team achieve its goals.
